                    Artificially intelligent robots are the bridge between robotics and AI. These are robots that are controlled by AI programsMost robots are not artificially intelligent. Up until quite recently, all industrial robots could only be programmed to carry out a repetitive series
                  of movements which, as we have discussed, do not require artificial intelligence. However, non-intelligent robots are quite limited in their functionality.AI algorithms are necessary when you want to allow the robot to perform more complex tasks.A warehousing robot might use a path-finding algorithm to navigate around the warehouse. A drone might use autonomous navigation to return home
                  when it is about to run out of battery. A self-driving car might use a combination of AI algorithms to detect and avoid potential hazards on the road.
                   These are all examples of artificially intelligent robots.

                            It can balance on one foot, but usually it walks upright and is strong enough to pick up and stack boxes weighting up to 40 pounds.
                            It can also fold itself for compact storage.
                             Ford envisions that Digit will ride in a driverless car and deliver packages to customers, automating the whole delivery process.
